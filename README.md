# DietTracker

CalCheck aims to build a functional multipurpose meal planner and generator app with a beautiful UI and basic features such as generating a unique meal plan each week that meets the calorie limit of the user, resetting the plan at a single click of a button. Our app will help users make informed decisions about the most important sphere of their daily lives, alongside sleep, and ensure users donâ€™t take rash decisions such as following fad diets that often cause more harm than good.
